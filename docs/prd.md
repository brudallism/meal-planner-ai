- Presence system for "AI typing" indicators

#### AI/LLM Integration Architecture

**Primary LLM Pipeline**:
```typescript
// Cloud Function: generateMealPlan
export const generateMealPlan = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const { userId, preferences, goals, conversationHistory } = data;
  
  // Step 1: Context assembly
  const userContext = await getUserNutritionContext(userId);
  const pantryItems = await getPantryInventory(userId);
  
  // Step 2: Prompt engineering
  const systemPrompt = buildNutritionistPersona(userContext);
  const userPrompt = assembleConversation(conversationHistory);
  
  // Step 3: LLM calls with fallback
  try {
    const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
      model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
      messages: [systemPrompt, ...userPrompt],
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 2000,
      functions: [generateMealSchema, macroCalculationSchema]
    });
    
    return parseAndValidateResponse(response);
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to Claude
    return await anthropic.complete({...});
  }
});
```

**Conversation Memory System**:
```typescript
// Vector database for conversation context
- Pinecone or Weaviate for embedding storage
- Store user preferences learned from conversations
- Retrieve relevant context for each interaction
- Maximum 10 conversation turn memory
```

**Hybrid API Integration Strategy**:
```yaml
Data Sources (3-API Bootstrap Approach):
  Primary APIs:
    - Open Food Facts API (Free) - Core nutrition data, barcode scanning, food product database
    - Spoonacular API ($10/month) - Meal planning, recipes, intelligent food ontology  
    - USDA FoodData Central API (Free) - Government nutritional data for accuracy
    - Supabase - User data, preferences, conversation history, meal plans

API Rate Limiting Strategy:
  - Spoonacular: 5 requests/second, 500/day (bootstrap plan)
  - Open Food Facts: Unlimited (respect fair use)
  - USDA: 1000 requests/hour
  - Parallel API calls where possible to optimize response times

Data Flow Architecture:
  User Chat → AI Processing → Multi-API Queries → Data Synthesis → Response
  
Fallback Strategies:
  - Spoonacular fails → Use cached recipes + USDA nutritional data
  - Open Food Facts barcode fails → Prompt user for manual food description  
  - USDA lookup fails → Use Spoonacular nutritional estimates
  - Always provide helpful responses, never expose API errors

Cost Analysis (Bootstrap Phase):
  - $10/month Spoonacular subscription
  - $0 for Open Food Facts and USDA APIs
  - Total bootstrap cost: $10/month for comprehensive nutrition intelligence

Caching Strategy:
  - Redis for frequently accessed foods (24-hour TTL)
  - Spoonacular recipe cache (7-day TTL)
  - USDA nutrition cache (30-day TTL) 
  - Open Food Facts product cache (7-day TTL)
  - User preference cache (real-time updates)
```

#### Location & Restaurant Integration

**Google Maps Integration**:
```javascript
// services/location.ts
const findNearbyRestaurants = async (userLocation, macroTargets) => {
  // Step 1: Places API for nearby restaurants
  const places = await googleMaps.nearbySearch({
    location: userLocation,
    radius: 3000,
    type: 'restaurant',
    openkitchen: true
  });
  
  // Step 2: Match with our nutrition database
  const matches = await matchRestaurantsWithMacros(places, macroTargets);
  
  // Step 3: Sort by macro compatibility score
  return sortByMacroMatch(matches);
};
```

**Restaurant Data Management**:
- Start with top 50 US chains (manually curated)
- Crowd-sourced data collection from users
- Integration with Nutritionix restaurant API
- Menu item photo → macro estimation (GPT-4 Vision)

#### Development & Deployment Pipeline

**Version Control & CI/CD**:
